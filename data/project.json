    "description": "Auteur - noun: a filmmaker whose personal influence and artistic control over a movie are so great that the filmmaker is regarded as the author of the movie.\n\nFilm is filled with entertainment blockbusters, Disney movies, [Insert film] #5, and more that kind of provides a disservice to the world of cinema and the medium of moving pictures. In opposition to this garbage, there are certain filmmakers who decide to strive for more. To push the limits on the artistic form and create art that holds its form decades after, and will for centuries. This project is a desire for me to further explore some of these filmmakers. Stanley Kubrick, Tomás Gutiérrez Alea, Akira Kurosawa, Wes Anderson, and many more. These, are some of the filmmakers who I think exemplify the term auteur.",
