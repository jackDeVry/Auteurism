Set in post-revolutionary Cuba, the film follows a former aristocrat who learns that his family’s fortune was hidden in one of twelve dining chairs, all of which have been confiscated and scattered by the new regime. Joined by a crafty conman posing as a priest, he embarks on a madcap search across the island. Infused with humor and political satire, the film critiques greed, nostalgia, and opportunism in the wake of revolutionary change."
