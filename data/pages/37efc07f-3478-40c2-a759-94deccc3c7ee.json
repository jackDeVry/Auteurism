          "text": " is a stop-motion animated film set in a dystopian future Japan, where all dogs have been exiled to Trash Island due to an outbreak of “canine flu.” The story follows Atari, a young boy who crash-lands on the island in search of his beloved dog, Spots. He is aided by a pack of misfit dogs, including the reluctant stray Chief. Blending meticulous visual design, deadpan humor, and a deep affection for its canine characters, the film explores themes of loyalty, loss, and resistance against authoritarianism."
