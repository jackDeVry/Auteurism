The film follows French Colonel Dax, played by Kirk Douglas, as he defends three soldiers accused of cowardice after a failed attack on a German position. As Dax confronts the brutal logic of military bureaucracy and the inhumanity of war, the film delivers a scathing critique of authority, nationalism, and the expendability of human life. Starkly shot and emotionally resonant, it is widely regarded as one of Kubrickâ€™s early masterpieces."
