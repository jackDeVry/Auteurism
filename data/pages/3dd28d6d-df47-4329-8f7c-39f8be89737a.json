The story follows Gustave H., a meticulous and flamboyant hotel concierge, and Zero, his loyal lobby boy, as they become entangled in the theft of a priceless painting and a family inheritance dispute. Framed as a story within a story, the film reflects on memory, nostalgia, and the fading grandeur of a bygone era. With its intricate production design, ensemble cast, and precise symmetry, it stands as one of Andersonâ€™s most acclaimed and stylized works."
