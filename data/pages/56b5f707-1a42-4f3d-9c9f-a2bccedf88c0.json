Led by a recently released ex-con named Johnny Clay, the meticulously planned crime begins to unravel due to human error and personal betrayal. Noted for its non-linear storytelling and precise editing, the film marked Kubrickâ€™s first major critical success and established his reputation as a director of exceptional control and vision."
