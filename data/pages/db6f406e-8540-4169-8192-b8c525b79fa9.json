These works are often attributed to one identifiable author—someone we hold responsible for the creative vision and execution. But what happens when you watch a film? Can we consider the director the \"author\" of a movie? Or is filmmaking such a collaborative endeavor that authorship becomes too diffused to assign to one person? These questions fuel a long-standing debate that took off in earnest with François Truffaut and his writings in Cahiers du Cinéma."

In contrast, auteurs like Kubrick or Anderson treat cinema as an art form, not just a storytelling vehicle. Their films may entertain, but their primary goal is often creative exploration, formal experimentation, or philosophical inquiry."
